## [Summary]
### Interesting Methods
- Reference [1]: Ensemble as an uncertainty quantification method

## [1] A Deep Ensemble Learning Approach to Lung CT Segmentation for COVID-19 Severity Assessment

### Problem Statement
- The lung disease is characterized by GGO and CON pathology. Existing studies present binary segmentation methodsfor dividing lung scans into healthy and non-healthy tissues while only a few studies yse multi-class segmentation techniques for separating between GGO and CON regions.

### Clinical Motivation
### Technical Motivation
### Contributions
- The proposed framework can distinguish between CON and GGO and has high generalization capabilities thanks to unique hierarchial network architectures and ensemble learning.
- Utilizing statistics of the ensemble independent predictions allows us to enhance the overall segmentation accuracy and to derive a measure of segmentation uncertainty.
