## Managing IT in Healthcare: A Discussion

### Interesting Methods and Insights
1. Every organization has IT management. Here, we focus on health settings. 

### Reflection
1. What do you know about how to manage IT in an organization? How about healthcare organizations?
- Financial banks are highly compliant with a variety of regulations such as GLB Act or Manual of Regulations for Financial Institutions and must have strict controls in place to ensure compliance.
- Data security and compliance: Hospitals are required to comply with regulations such as HIPAA, which governs the handling of personal health information (PHI). Banks, on the other hand, must comply with regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which focus on financial data security. 
- Financial banks are highly invested in digital technology to improve customer service. Whereas, hospitals are not heavily open or reliant to new technologies since they focus on patients' safety.
- Financial data can easily be integrated across different central banks since they follow the international standards of accounting. Systems integration: Hospitals have a wide variety of systems and devices that must be integrated, such as electronic health records (EHRs), imaging systems, and medical devices. Banks also have a wide variety of systems, but these are mainly focused on financial data.
- Scalability: Hospitals must be able to scale their IT systems to handle a large number of patients and data, while banks must be able to scale their systems to handle a large number of customers and transactions.

3. What did you learn from previous courses that help you answer the above questions?
- Clinical workflows:  IT systems in hospitals must be designed to support and integrate with clinical workflows, such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, and prescribing medication.
- Stakeholders from various organization respond differently to technologies. In financial banks where security are highly prioritized, they cater to different startup organizations who offer new technologies that can improve customers' satisfactions and improve financial performance. 

4. What else do I need to know in order to successfully manage IT in your organization?
Both hospitals and banks have their own specific challenges, for example, in a hospital, there may be more workarounds related to patient care and treatment, while in banks, there may be more workarounds related to financial transactions and customer service. It's important for these organizations to identify and address the root causes of errors and workarounds to prevent them from happening in the future.


- Vision is what you see in th future. What you aim to be. The vision answers how(?).
- Mission: What do you do?
- The strategic point links the vision and mission.  An organization with the same vision and similar mission can have different strategies - depending on their context on what is the best pathway for their organization. The strategy does not care to day-to-day operations. One level below the strategy is the tactical approach - that is, you spell out the high level strategy that are more manageable and concrete.
