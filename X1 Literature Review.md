### Tumor cells pass themselves off as platelets to go undetected in the bloodstream. 
- This finding constitutes a paradigm shift in terms of how the metastatic process unfolds.
- Metastatic: the spread of cancer cells from the place where they first formed to another part of the body. Cancer that spreads from where it started to a distant part of the body is called metastatic cancer. For many types of cancer, it is also called stage IV (4) cancer. 
- Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death, due to the release of tumour cells (i.e., Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs)) from a primary tumour into the bloodstream, where they can travel to another organ and create a secondary tumour.

###  Tumor cells acquire part of the configuration of platelets to trick the body into believing they are platelets, enabling them to take over other organs. 


### Research: How tumor cells camouflage to avoid detection in the bloodstream
- Data from these assays showed that platelets transferred structural components to tumor cells with higher efficiency than tumor cells to platelets (p = 0.001). This biological interplay occurred by direct contact, internalization or via extracellular vesicles. As a result, tumor cells acquired platelet markers (CD61 and CD42), showed decreased EpCAM, expressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, and increased proliferation rates. Moreover, we were able to detect CD61 in CTCs from early and advanced prostate cancer.
