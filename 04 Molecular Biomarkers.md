- The surgical resection is the only treatment for pancreatic cancer. Only a minority of patients can obtain surgery and improving the overall survival rate is still a major challenge. 
- Molecular biomarkers are a significant approach for diagnostic and predictive use in pancreatic cancers.
- Precise biomarkers are urgently required to increase the efficiency of predicting a disease-free survival, overall survival, and sensitivity to immunotherapy in PC patients and improve the prognosis of PC. 

- Results: 
    - LAMB3, FN1, KRT17, KRT19, and ANXA1 were defined as the top five upregulated targets in PC compared with paracancer.
    - Significantly, LAMB3, FN1, KRT19, and ANXA1 but not KRT17 can be considered as biomarkers for survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and risk model analysis.
